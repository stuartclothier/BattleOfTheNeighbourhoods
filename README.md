# BattleOfTheNeighbourhoods

##  IBM capstone project

#### Project Goals

This project seeks to cluster neighbourhoods in Toronto based on postalcode and borough information. 

Postal code information has been sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M).

Notebook files can be found in the NotebookFiles folder, where each version will represent each stage of the project.
