Toronto:
Goals:
-[x] Scrape wiki for neighbourhoods
-[x] add geographical information of neighbourhoods
-[x] Create map of Neighbourhood locations
-[/] Get venues information for neighbourhoods
	-[/] Function for FourSquare API call - Could be optimised? (e.g. documentation, LIMIT needs to be defined prior to run - should probably be a kwarg, optional kwargs? 
		(radius, LIMIT), list append function > Dataframe function
	-[/] Function for converting venue category to parent category - probably ok but would be good if didn't need to use cat_list in args
-[/] K mean cluster neigbourhoods based on nearby venues:
	-[/] try different radii for Foursquare API call - explain why I am doing this?
		Radius: 1000
		-[/] Find appropriate values for K - tidy up and documentation
		-[/] plot - tidy up and documentation
		-[ ] analyse clusters, i.e. why is a neighbourhood in a particular cluster?
		Radius: 500

-[ ] Final obs and comments


Final checklist:
- [ ] does it run? 'reset and run all' at any point
- [ ] are objects/vars named in a coherent manner?
- [ ] is there sufficient markdown/inline comments?
- [ ] Is each cell re-runable multiple times
- [ ] do any cells need spliting/merging - do they give output? 
- [ ] should/can the notebook be split? (highly likely not)
