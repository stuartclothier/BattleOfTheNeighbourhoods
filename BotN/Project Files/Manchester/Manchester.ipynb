Initially, Geopunk was scraped for postcode information, however once it was compared to this CSV it was found that many postcodes were missing from the Geopunk source. The csv file alone will be used for all postcode district geographical information as it is considerably easier to work with and any extra work to scrape websites or search for geographical co-ordinates with Geopy is superfluous.\n",
